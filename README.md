This Project contains entire STMproject with GPIO drivers written. It can be used directly by downloading and writing application code in main.c. Also GPIO API files can be copied to other project ad can be used.\
/stm32f4xx_GPIO_Drivers/drivers/ folder has driver API written for GPIO access. \
Header file /drivers/stm32f411xx.h  has all register and macros defined for GPIO, Clock Initialization, SPI, I2C, UART.\
GPIO API functions are defined in /drivers/Inc/stm32f411xx_gpio_driver.h\
GPIO API are implemented in /drivers/Inc/stm32f411xx_gpio_driver.c\
Note: Make sure driver path is included in INC.
